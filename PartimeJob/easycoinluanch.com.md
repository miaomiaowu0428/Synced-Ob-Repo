Thank you for your recognition! Looks like you want to build a website to help users who don't know about writing code to publish their own token on solana. This goal is acturally some kind of complicated:
1. You need to have a **domain** that user can easly access your service.
2. You need to have a **server**(**physical or** leased from **cloud** service provider).
	or more servers if you gain more user.
3. You need **operations staff** to provide continuous service to user.
And here's something to confirm:
1. My work is to build a program which can automaticlly create tokens. Or do I also need to complete the functions of automatically creating a liquidity pool, and injecting or withdrawing liquidity in the liquidity pool?





I'm sorry for the slow reply. Because our country is celebrating the Spring Festival. I have been visiting my relatives and attending class reunions in the past and next few days.

If you're not in a hurry, I will evaluate the price in detail for you on next Tuesday or Wednesday. But for now, I can only provide you with a broad price range: Depending on the complexity of your specific requirements, the price of this project may be around $300 - $1500. Additionally, due to different regulations in different countries, I may not be able to assist you with operations such as purchasing domain names and leasing servers. You can visit GoDaddy and AWS (or other domain name and cloud server providers). If you're ready with these, I can help you log in to your server to complete the deployment, or assist you in completing the deployment operation yourself by providing the deployment script .
